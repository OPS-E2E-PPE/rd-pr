  ## Bio
  Hi, I’m Daron. I'm helping organizations getting most out of their cloud investments. [Reach out](http://www.deveload.com) if interested! 
  
  I blog on [http://daron.blog](http://daron.blog), [tweet](http://www.twitter.com/daronyondem), [take photos](https://www.instagram.com/daronyondem/), lead [Teknolot](https://www.meetup.com/Teknolot/) and love software.
  
  I speak in international conferences and write books during holidays :)
  
  Microsoft calls me [Most Valuable Professional](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/4015692?fullName=Daron%2520%2520Yondem) for 12 years now, and
  "Microsoft Regional Director" for 11. During these years my expertise spanned
  around both client and server technologies.
  
  Hope to get in touch and see what we can accomplish together. Feel free to talk to me
  about: Serverless, AI, CosmosDB, IoT, DevOps, Azure.
  
  Stay in the flow ;)

  ## Spotlight
  Cloud is not a magic marketing word, or the next technology leap that
  companies should adopt just for future-proofing and appearances. Migrating to
  cloud is a tough decision that has its challenges, but also its rewards. Cloud
  makes it possible for businesses to reach global scale faster and make global
  operations of online businesses more approachable.
  
  I fully understand the ups and down of various decisions around on-premise,
  private, public and hybrid cloud investments. At Xomni, we help retailers move
  their in-store experiences to the cloud and scale from a single prototype to
  deployments of thousands of locations with a single switch. It’s crucial to
  keep the initial cloud migration investment minimum, but maintain the ability
  to scale when needed. The fundamental idea of being able to start from zero
  and expand without limits is what makes the cloud an invaluable technology.
  
  With the same philosophy, we launched a digital signage platform called XOGO
  where small and medium business can start building a digital signage
  infrastructure with zero costs and scale when needed. Helping companies,
  technical or business decision makers, and developers to understand the pure
  form of cloud and the real value behind it is a joy for me.
