  ## Bio
  Hi, I’m Vincent. I’m a Microsoft Regional Director working for VISEO and
  living in Lyon, France.
  
  I am a fan of technology, Cloud, Agility and innovation. I’m also interested
  in hiking/travelling, DIY, NPL and Montessori ! You can read my blog with a
  click on the button above.
  
  As a living, I am helping companies transforming their businesses by using the
  Cloud from Executive level, down to the architecture/code.
  
  I am expert on Azure (awarded MVP Azure), on DevOps and Agility. As such, I
  write articles, and often get invited to many conferences to share my insights
  and expertise, in France or abroad (UK, Switzerland).
  
  I am the co-founder of the Azure User Group France (AZUG FR), and locally, I
  am on the board of the Microsoft User Group Lyon (MUG Lyon).
  
  Don't ask me questions about these topics unless you have many hours in front
  of you !
