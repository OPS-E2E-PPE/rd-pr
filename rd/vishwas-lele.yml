  ## Spotlight
  I have been fortunate to be a part of the fascinating Azure journey from the
  very beginning. Over the past 10 years, I have had the opportunity to work
  with many facets of Azure: programming, writing, working with customers, and
  presenting to thousands of developers around the world.
  
  These experiences have helped me arrive at the notion of what I call **cloud
  thinking**. Cloud thinking is about a mindset that goes beyond moving an
  existing application to the cloud or building a new application that is born
  in the cloud. Cloud thinking is a solution-focused approach to building
  applications that maximizes the benefits that cloud has to offer. It starts
  with understanding the motivation and constraints in moving to the cloud.
  Next, it progresses to prototyping designed to select the right set of
  building blocks that the cloud platform has to offer that considers agility,
  cost, SLA, the roadmap of future capabilities, and of course, security and
  compliance. The final phase converts the prototype into a production
  application that is well-instrumented to collect data about its usage and
  overall health, thereby allowing it to be improved continuously.
