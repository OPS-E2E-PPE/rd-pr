  ## Bio
  I am the CTO and Co-Founder of [DevOpsGuys ](http://www.devopsguys.com/)and a
  [Microsoft Regional Director. ](http://www.msrd.io/)
  
  I started in IT in 1990 as a junior programmer subcontracted to IBM working on
  mainframe systems management software (Netview). After about 3 years of this I
  decided I wasn’t well suited to spending my whole life behind a desk and I
  wanted a more hands-on role, so I got involved in setting up a server and
  local area network in my companies office (at the time this was Novell Netware
  3.x and Winfows For Workgroups 3.11).
  
  I then started supporting Microsoft LanManager and other Microsoft systems.
  Over the next 15 or so years I worked my way up through 1st/2nd/3rd line
  support into senior engineering and technical architecture roles, with an
  increasing specialisation (since 1998) in Microsoft web hosting platforms
  based in Windows NT / Windows Server and IIS. When I moved to the UK in 1999 I
  worked in that capacity for large enterprise organisations like BNP Paribas,
  Vodafone, CSFB etc.
  
  In 2005 I moved to Totaljobs as their web operations manager, running their
  online job board platform which is based on high-volume Windows/.Net/IIS/SQL
  Server platform.
  
  After leaving Totaljobs in 2008 I had had a series of roles around web
  operations, monitoring and performance leading up to the founding of
  [DevOpsGuys](http://www.devopsguys.com/), one of UK leading DevOps
  consultancies and a Microsoft Gold partner in 2013.
  
  My involvement in the DevOps community grew via [extensive
  blogging](https://blog.devopsguys.com/), presenting at conferences like
  [QCON](https://qconlondon.com/london-2015/speakers/stephen-thair.html),
  [Atmosphere](http://2015.atmosphere-conference.com/speakers/stephen-thair) and
  different London DevOps Meetups (including our own [DevOps
  Cardiff](http://www.meetup.com/DevOps-Cardiff/)) we felt that the Microsoft
  and Windows community was significantly under-represented by the existing
  DevOps meetups so we coined the term #Winops and organised the first ever
  “DevOps on Windows” conference [WinOpsConf](http://www.winops.org/) in Sept
  2015 and so we decided to follow this up with a regular monthly meetup
  [WinOpsLDN](http://www.meetup.com/WinOps/).

  ## Spotlight
  Enterprise organisations are struggling to cope with Digital Transformation –
  they are rapidly being overtaken by faster, nimbler, cloud-native new entrants
  across a wide range of markets. Many of these Enterprises are unable to
  respond to these challengers due to mountains of technical debt in their
  legacy systems, heavily fragmented and siloed organisational structures and a
  lack of core capabilities within the IT function due to years of outsourcing.
  CIO’s and CTO’s need to rebuild their in-house product development
  capabilities to bring new, innovative products to market if they want to stay
  relevant to today’s consumers.
  
  DevOps methodologies, focusing on product-centric, cross-functional teams that
  design, build and run cloud-hosted solutions are seen as a key part of
  responding to this digital transformation. Unfortunately, many organisations
  are struggling to implement DevOps successfully, choosing to focus only on new
  tools and automation while ignoring the cultural and leadership challenges
  inherent in designing a new operating model for IT. My team and I are working
  with large Enterprises to devise training and coaching programmes to help kick
  start the cultural transformation, consultancy techniques to identify key pain
  points, as well as accelerating their technical transformation via DevOps
  engineering.
