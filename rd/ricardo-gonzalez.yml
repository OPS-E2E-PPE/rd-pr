  ## Bio
  I am co-founder and CEO of Androcial Media Inc.
  
  I solve problems!
  
  I am a Senior Architecture and Software Development expert with more than 18
  Years of experience in different business as Telco, Health Care, Banking,
  Digital Marketing, among others. I specialized in software development
  processes and software architecture & design. Many activities related to
  design and implementation optimization under different technologies, and
  platforms.
  
  My passion is to help customers to solve real problems with the right use of
  technology. Ranging from the Business Technology Strategy to Design and Human
  Dynamics. Transition to the cloud and integration of cross platform systems is
  a big part of it. In most of the cases, during that process, my work covers
  the interaction with multidisciplinary teams that include CxO, Engineering,
  Operations, and Development people.
  
  Since university I've been a fanatic of AI and embedded systems, Right now is
  a very exciting time for that.

  professor in Software Architecture, Design and Development subjects. Some
  other ways are as a frequent speaker in tech conferences and regional
  technical communities
