  ## Bio
  In a nutshell, I’m a tech-loving, ex-Microsoft productivity guru and EdTech entrepreneur. I’ve been passionate about technology ever since my father brought home our very first personal computer in the early 80-s. I feel truly blessed for having found my true calling, which is to help others get more value out of technology by showing what is possible and communicating that through storytelling. 

  With a Master of Science (MSc) in Electrical Engineering from the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, I started my career at Microsoft Sweden in 1997 as a Systems Engineer on SQL Server. Ten years later I moved to Dubai, and joined Microsoft Gulf as their first Information Worker Solution Specialist covering the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait.   

  In 2011, after finishing my EMBA at London Business School, and having our first son, I decided to take the plunge and resign from Microsoft to found my own company. I started Business Productivity – a media production and consulting company focused on bridging the gap between business and IT to increase business productivity . A few years down the line, when it was evident that the world was all about subscription-based services, I launched my second company, Storyals. Storyals, which derives from “story-based tutorials” offers a Microsoft 365 adoption solution with story-based, digital learning to help organizations get more out of their digital workplace. With Storyals, I get to work daily with amazing people that share my passion of helping organizations all over the world simply work smarter. 
  In addition to running two companies, I also run after our three kids, age 10, 8 and 5 and in between everything else I frequently blog, record videos and speak at events. I’m married to Peter who fortunately shares my favorite screen-free relaxation - jigsaw puzzles!

  Please feel free to connect with me at any time to discuss digital leadership, best practices using Microsoft Teams or anything else related to working smarter in the modern workplace.
