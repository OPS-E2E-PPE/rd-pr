  ## Bio
  I am an entrepreneur and consultant in the Software Architecture field from
  Milan, Italy, serving as the CTO of Managed Designs yet still being eager to
  write production code in order to get feedback about my architectural
  decisions.
  
  I am the lead developer of MementoFX, an event sourcing framework aimed at
  making the development of "time travelling software" a breeze.
  
  As a trainer and speaker, I had several speaking engagements for courses and
  conferences across Europe such as TechEd, Codemotion and DevWeek; 
  I taught "Operating Systems" during the "Master in Editoria
  Multimediale" class organized by the University “Politecnico of Milan”.
  
  In 2001 I co-founded UGIdotNET (http://www.ugidotnet.org), the first Italian
  .NET User Group, of which I am the President and leader.
  
  My ultimate passion is music, being devoted to Depeche Mode with whom I fell
  in love with since listening to Everything Counts for the first time.
  
  Talk to me about: Software Architecture, Domain Driven Design, CQRS, Event
  Sourcing, ASP.NET, .NET Core, Azure

  ## Spotlight
  As a long-time Domain Driven Design practitioner, I warmly welcomed the advent
  of Event Sourcing as a persistence strategy. What got me into the use of
  events as a fundamental information chunk is that you can replay them to
  rebuild any past system’s state, thus solving the problems of simulations and
  information versioning.
  
  Back in the day, though, you couldn’t rely on already existing .NET SDKs to
  leverage event management and persistence. To address this problem my company,
  Managed Designs, and I implemented MementoFX, an ad-hoc application framework.
  Released on NuGet under an open source license in April 2016, the suite has
  been downloaded more than 6500 times up to January 2017.
  
  Since then, we have been evolving MementoFX to make it the tool of choice for 
  architects and developers building event-processing applications such as 
  BI or IoT systems, whether they are on-premises or cloud-based. 
  For how much services such as Event Hubs or Azure IoT, just to name a few, are 
  impeccable event collectors, software applications do need to bind these events 
  to business logic to produce consolidated results and that’s where MementoFX 
  kicks in, making this onerous task a breeze.
