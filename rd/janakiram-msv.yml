  ## Spotlight
  Once in every five years, the technology industry goes through a major
  overhaul. The last wave of disruption came in the form of cloud computing,
  impacting almost every segment of the industry including hardware
  manufacturers, infrastructure companies, operating system vendors, and
  platform companies. So, whatâ€™s next for the cloud?
  
  Cloud providers like Microsoft have started to invest in the next set of
  technologies that will be delivered as managed services to customers. Cloud
  Computing is moving away from traditional delivery models involving compute,
  storage, networking services to verticalized platform offerings. Analytics,
  Blockchain, cognitive computing, IoT, machine learning, media services,
  microservices, and serverless computing are examples of the emerging cloud
  services.
  
  As one of the early movers in the market, Microsoft has taken the lead in
  driving the next generation cloud services. Azure is slowly but steadily
  moving into a data-centric world of cloud computing. Its investment in
  storage, databases, analytics, cognitive computing, and machine learning are
  justifying the branding of intelligent cloud. Going forward, I expect
  Microsoft to increase its investments in Artificial Intelligence, IoT, and
  Edge Computing taking Azure to the next level.
