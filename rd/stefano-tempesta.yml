  ## Bio
  Co-founder and Director at 365 Community, the non-profit organization behind the "Dynamics 365 Saturday" brand (www.365portal.org),
  involved in evangelizing and educating partners and customers about best practices for customer relationship management (CRM).
  I'm a Microsoft MVP on three categories: Azure, AI and Business Applications.
  A regular speaker at international IT conferences, including Microsoft Ignite and Tech Summit,
  my interests extend to blockchain and AI-related technologies.
  I have created "Blogchain Space" (blogchain.space), a blog about blockchain technologies,
  I write for MSDN Magazine and MS Dynamics World,
  and I publish Machine Learning experiments on the Azure AI Gallery.
  I like to consider myself a technology ambassador of beautiful software,
  experienced in the end-to-end software development practice and agile team leadership.
  A passionate traveler, a poor musician, and an avid learner of new technologies and (programming) languages.
  Have a can-do think-positive attitude. People say I live at a different speed.
  I hold British and Italian citizenship, and speak fluent English, Italian, and terrible Russian.
