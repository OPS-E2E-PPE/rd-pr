  ## Bio
  Making people’s lives better through software!
  
  I’m a Principal Consultant at Skyline Technologies, Microsoft Regional
  Director (RD), and a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) in Windows
  development. I work with C-Suites and boards to advise them on complex
  business problems, while still spending time developing solutions. Involvement
  in the community is important to me and I serve on some non-profit boards for
  IT Advisory and help colleges with curricula to keep up with business needs.
  
  Over the years, I’ve gained experience in a wide variety of technologies. I
  spent the majority of the 90s developing on UNIX and Linux systems, while
  jumping over to Windows for game development. After the turn of the
  millennium, my primary dev stack switched to Windows. Now it bounces between
  Windows and macOS to reach cross platform solutions. One of the common tools
  I’ve used over all of those platforms is Vim; Vim > Emacs!
  
  Besides speaking at conferences, I’m a board member of ThatConference,
  president of the Milwaukee Code Camp, president of the Northeast WI Code Camp,
  president of the Northeast WI Developers User Group, co-organizer of the Fox
  Valley Game Development Meetup, co-organizer of the MidwestAzureUser Group,
  organizer of MobileMKE, cofounder of the Northeast WIAgile User Group, IEEE
  member, ACM member, and a Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT). I’m strong
  supporter of TEALS to help STEM growth!
  
  I’m a true enthusiast of computer science, with undergraduate and graduate
  degrees in computer science, along with some PhD studies. I enjoy substituting
  at universities when the opportunity arises.
  
  Along with being a life-long geek, I enjoy golfing, football, woodworking,
  philosophy and a tasty BBQ.

  Intelligence (AI), Emerging Experiences, Internet of Things (IoT), Cross
