  ## Bio
  I am the founder and owner of [Arana Software](https://www.aranasoft.com), a
  web software consulting firm headquartered in Las Vegas.

  As a software consultant, I have been developing solutions on the web since
  1995, when the Blink tag lured me away from Visual Basic 3. Through my
  collaboration and contributions to software development, I have been awarded
  as a Microsoft Regional Director, an ASPInsider, and as a seven-time Microsoft
  MVP.

  Recognizing that the bottleneck to great software is a developerâ€™s time, my
  continuing quest is for frameworks, modules, tools, and practices that make
  developers stronger, fitter, happier, and more productive. "Typing is not the
  hardest part of the day;" I strive for efficiency in implementation, so that
  we can focus on imagining ideas, solving problems, and providing solutions.

  I am also president of [GiveCamp Inc.](http://givecamp.org/), a non-profit
  through which software developers, graphic designers, social media experts and
  other technologists volunteer their time and skills to help their local
  charities.

  Talk to me about: [Software Consulting](https://www.aranasoft.com), Web Development,
  [GiveCamp](http://givecamp.org/), Speaking, and
  visting Las Vegas.
