  ## Spotlight
  In the last 20 years, I’ve had the great opportunity to help organizations transform their business by maximizing the full breadth of Microsoft technologies. As we’ve shifted to the cloud, it’s exciting to see how organizations and individuals are empowered to quickly deliver impactful solutions with the Microsoft cloud. 
  
  With technologies ranging from Microsoft Teams to Microsoft AI, we’re entering into an era where technology is not only accessible to the limited few, but [it has become inclusive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/us-partner-blog/2020/01/08/avepoints-dux-raymond-sy-on-four-ways-to-jumpstart-diversity-and-inclusion-within-your-company/) 
  that everyone can create solutions to meet their needs – whether it’s a [bot that restores deleted emails or files](https://www.avepoint.com/products/cloud/citizen-services),
  [a citizen services platform](https://www.avepoint.com/products/cloud/citizen-services) or [AI powered learning management system](https://www.avepoint.com/sg/solutions/learning-management-system/).
  
  I believe the Microsoft Cloud can be the great equalizer - a catalyst for the digital transformation of every organization thanks to its ability to scale easier and deliver innovation faster with less resources required. I am grateful for the opportunity to be a part of the Microsoft extended family and be able to help organizations strengthen their tech intensity.
