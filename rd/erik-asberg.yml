  With over 20 years’ experience from the energy & IT field, I know a few things
  about the technology challenges the energy- and related industries face, and
  how they can navigate towards a modern, cloud based architecture and still be
  compliant with industry specific regulations.
  
  My expertise is how to leverage the use of new technology to strengthen your
  business through complete eco-systems in Microsoft Azure, utilizing PaaS.
  
  On a day-to-day basis, I work on enterprise level Digital Transformation and
  how to merge and integrate an existing system portfolio with a Microsoft Azure
  based platform, strategically with an architectural focus.
  
  I also have a strong interest in startups and how they can use the
  possibilities that come with the Microsoft BizSpark program to speed up
  growth.
