  ## Bio
  I am a software generalist with 20+ years of professional experience and a
  deep specialization in the Microsoft technology platform. I have extensive
  experience in fields like development, code auditing, architectural
  transformation and technology strategy.
  
  I am also known as a public speaker, particularly in Microsoft-related events.
  Developing the local tech community is one of my passions - I have founded and
  ran the Finnish .NET User Group SANKO since 2010. Finnish listeners can also
  hear me out on our regular Microsoft-focused podcast,
  [Ikkunastudio](http://www.ikkunastud.io).
  
  I work as the CEO of Offbeat Solutions, a software company I founded with my
  wife and some friends. Our specialty is rescuing failed projects, but we help
  our customers with all sorts of tech challenges - adopting new technologies,
  coaching floundering teams or facilitating cross-tech projects are all routine
  for us. Quite obviously, Azure and other cloud services are pretty much what
  drives us these days.
  
  Talk to me about: Cloud Computing, Microservices, Software Development, Azure,
  PaaS, .NET, Visual Studio

  ## Spotlight
  I’m excited about how cloud adoption spreads like wildfire. Finland has always
  been fairly cloud-savvy – for example, we have Office 365 seats for 20% of the
  population – but much of the adoption has been about Infrastructure or
  Software as a Service. That’s a great first step, but I believe the true
  business revolution starts with platform services.
  
  I’ve been blessed with great customers who have been willing to explore the
  Azure platform far and wide. I’ve been publishing data through modern managed
  APIs, composing IoT data ingestion pipelines and building cloud-based service
  buses. On that path, we’ve found great business successes – increasing vendor
  independence, unlocking new insights from forgotten assets, and turning old
  daily batch integrations into valuable real-time data streams are just a few
  examples.
  
  Not every technology adoption is bliss. Successful digitalization is all about
  modernizing swiftly while embracing and leveraging the legacy we all have. No
  matter if you look for cost reduction, quality improvement or extra revenue,
  picking the right services for the job is the first step. I’m excited to be on
  the forefront of Microsoft’s massive service evolution - and happy to navigate
  the maze with you.
