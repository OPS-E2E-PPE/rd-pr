  ## Bio
  In 2010, along with my close friend, Ian Roberts, I started Tangent Solutions.
  A cloud first, digital solutions consulting company that focuses on digital
  transformation.
  
  I love everything about cloud application development and all the different spectrums it touches. As Tangent is a open source company I'm a major fan
  of Microsoft's adoption and support of Open Source technologies. Right now I'm excited about Azure Container Services (ACS or AKS), microservices and the Azure Bot Framework.
  Additionally I love mobile develpment. I'm proficient on iOS and Android, Xamarin Forms, Xamarin Native and true Native. I've done my time on HTML hybrids, and hope not to do it again.
  
  I enjoy working with developer communities and am involved with a couple of
  User Groups. Currently I'm the organizer of the Azure User Group in
  Johannesburg, have recently launched AzDev (Azure Development) as well as speak at the occasional non-Microsoft related User Group.
  
  I'm very passionate about digital transformation. But digital transformation
  done right. This means targeted MVPs with a DevOps delivery. This approach
  allows for a improved build quality, reduced costs and most importantly, a
  quicker time to market.
  
  Throughtout my career I've gained broad exposure to Information Technology
  across South Africa doing work for SMEs, mid-size corporates and large scale
  enterprises including amongst others, the JSE, Investec, Standard Bank,
  Vodacom, Sun International and Liberty Life.
  
  I have my Masters in Information Technology and Philosophy and thoroughly
  enjoy a good debate.
  
  I've spoken at a number of events in South Africa and internationally about Digital
  Transformation, the power of the Cloud, Bots and the Azure Bot Framework, Xamarin and mobile DevOps.
  
  Talk to me about Cloud Modernization, Azure, Bots, Xamarin, Microsoft and Open
  Source.
