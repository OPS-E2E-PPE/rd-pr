  ## Spotlight
  According to the EU Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) portal, in
  2016 40 Egyptian agriculture shipments were rejected from entering the EU.
  This happens annually, leading to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses of
  Egyptian exports.
  
  My company, CompuPharaohs, is designing a solution that integrates state-of-
  the-art Azure technologies to deliver a high availability, intelligent
  traceability system that delivers a rigid set of insights, patterns discovery,
  and capacity planning from deep learning techniques that utilizes Azure
  Machine Learning, and HDInsight. The source of the data is an IoT solution
  designed to deliver the core insights about the used amounts of cultivation
  materials. The development leverages Visual Studio Team Services as well as
  SQL Server 2016.
  
  An intelligent, integrated information platform for agribusiness could improve
  the capacities of producers by increasing productivity and enhancing quality
  compliance. Ultimately, the solution aims to strengthen the linkages of the
  value chain and support Egyptian producers’ groups, all while increasing
  access to international and domestic markets.
