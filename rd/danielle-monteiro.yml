  ## Bio
  I am a master in computer engineering, Microsoft MVP (Data Platform category), MongoDB Innovation Award Winner for work with communities (Wiliam Zola Award), MongoDB Female Innovator, TEDx Speaker.
  I really love to work with data! 
  I am WDB.Consulting founder, a consultancy focused on database solutions and training, data architecture, data governance and cloud computing.
  I spoke in major events inside and outside Brazil.  I love to speak because I'm a person who talks a lot and I love being in contact with the community. I am even happier if the conversation is about technology and is accompanied by a coffee.
