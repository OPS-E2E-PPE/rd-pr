  ## Bio
  Hi, I am Rotem Rozmarin, Consultant, Architect, Founder of SunSpots.cloud and recognized as a Microsoft Regional Director (RD) specializing in Cloud Governance and Security.
  
  We provide a SaaS AI Multi-Cloud Platform for real time Infographics Mapping Security & Governance Management with the ability to automatically scan your entire cloud environment and convert all the data into Visual Graphic Discovery Maps.
  
  Prior to founding SunSpots.cloud, I founded R-Net db and was acting as a CTO and CEO in many major cloud organizations.
  
  With vast technical management experience in large global technological companies, I have been fortunate to have nominated for the following World awards:
      • Microsoft Partner of the year Award 2014
      • World Finalist DevOps Partner of the Year Award 2017
      • World Winner Microsoft Partner 2018 of the Year Award

  Many of my projects turned into best practice showcases for the successful use of Cloud Technology and Data Transformation.
  
  I greatly enjoy working with people and being active in the tech community, and I always aim to produce project results that will help both companies and humans (technology helps humanity).
 
  Ultimately, I believe that visualization and transparency should provide an organization with the reality and clarity they need to manage their clouds in a better way.
