  ## Spotlight
  My passion for IT started during high school in the 1990s. To finance
  university I worked as an early software trainer, teaching other students and
  Enterprises how to use new technologies. I was often asked why – as a woman –
  was I interested in computers? But for me it’s not about gender – it’s about
  passion. Knowledge grows through sharing and my passion is to share and help
  the community better understand technology.
  
  In 2008, I turned my focus towards cloud computing. It is amazing what
  benefits and capabilities this technology delivers to organizations and
  customers. Starting with Office 365 as my focus, I first learned how a product
  and a market grows, evolves and influences everyone. Office 365 was a starting
  point for me and let me look into Azure Identities, security and SaaS as well,
  I see capabilities for organizations like they were never before. Each day we
  see new possibilities through cloud computing as well as new challenges we
  need to face. To be an early adopter my focus today is to help customers in
  this digital change in their mindsets.
  
  On the other hand, I saw how much change technology can bring into
  enterprises. The digital transformation, as we speak about today, is something
  which brings disruption and change into every industry. To be constructive and
  confident about how helpful technology is we focus change in the way we work
  as well as in our communication.
  
  With our own product, Delegate365, our company developed an add-on for Office
  365 which closes a gap in bringing delegation and license management
  capabilities to large customers who use Office 365 in a single tenant
  scenario.
