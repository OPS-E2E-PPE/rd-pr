  ## Bio
  I grew up in a small town in Michigan. After college I moved to California and
  worked as an aerospace engineer for 12 years.
  
  Today I'm the CEO of DesignMind, a San Francisco-based consulting firm. We
  deliver Big Data and Data Analytics Consulting, including Systems Integration,
  Data Engineering, Master Data Management, Cloud Solutions, and Enterprise
  Mobility Solutions.
  
  DesignMind is a Microsoft Gold Partner in Data Analytics and Data Platform.
  
  Ask me about Power BI, the Microsoft BI stack, SQL Server, Azure and Azure
  data-related services, Master Data Management, Hadoop and Cassandra.
  
  If I don’t have the answer, I know someone who does, and I'll connect you. And
  if you're coming to San Francisco or Silicon Valley, let’s try to connect!
  
  • I run four Microsoft user groups in the Bay Area.
  
  • I served on the Board of Directors for PASS, a global community of database
  professionals.
  
  • I've been a Data Platform MVP for the past six years.
  
  • At DesignMind we have a top notch team and we do work for several of the
  world’s great companies.
  
  • I live in Marin County, just north of San Francisco with my wife, 12 year
  old twin boys, and several dogs that make my life happy and fulfilling.
