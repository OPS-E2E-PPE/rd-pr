  ## Bio
  Hi, Iâ€™m Robert. I'm a CTO at Active Solution - a consulting services firm
  based in Stockholm, Sweden, focusing on helping customers build cloud based
  solutions. I'm deeply passionate about technology and how the digital
  transformation is changing our way of living, how we work and how our society
  functions as a whole.
  
  As the CTO of Active Solution I am responsible for the overall technical and
  architectural strategy for the company. I am also responsible for constantly
  keeping our skills and knowledge up to date through cutting edge projects,
  training with the worlds best experts and knowledge sharing between colleagues
  and projects.
  
  As a public speaker I love doing regular appearances at conferences like
  Developer Summit, TechDays and TechX - speaking about cloud computing, machine
  learning and architecture - among other things. This year I'm honored and
  happy to be part of the Developer Summit Advisory Board.
  
  I'm also a Microsoft Regional Director. That doesn't mean that I work for
  Microsoft, but that they have recognized my knowledge and community leadership
  by awarding me the title.
