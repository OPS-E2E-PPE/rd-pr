  ## Bio
  Hello, 

  My name is Mateusz. For last six years I have build Microsoft ecosystem (startups, technologies, education) and focused on boosting my experience & knowledge in line with Microsoft activities. I would like to do it more effective and scale up my works, duties, possibilities to empower powerfull technology in companies, startups, ISVs and other worth instutions. My goal for the next five years is to become a business angel in 12 startups that have powerfull technology. Take a challenge and change the world together.

  Below, short brief about my experience:

  Leading influencer in Eastern and Central Poland in the field of startups and entrepreneurship. Recognizable by every young person developing a startup. Despite his insanely young age, he went through the road from building a startup which represented Poland during the Imagine Cup finals in the US, through business management and ending as an investor financing ideas with high growth potential. The adventure began with the choice as Microsoft Student Partner at alma mater - Maria Curie-Sk≈Çodowska University.

  Actually working on:

  Techni Ventures Partner - company supporting companies from Central and Eastern Europe in obtaining financing, building company value, globalization of activities, focusing on bridge to New York - giving the opportunity to exchange best practice with one of the most dynamic markets and opening the door of unlimited possibilities.

  CEO Venture Capital Development - company that supports startups in the pre-seed, seed, and growth phases. The company is the managing partner of one of the Business Angels Network. The company was founded in response to the problem identified in the startup environment which is the lack of support in the process of looking for investments. A wide network faciliates supporting projects by sharing the know-how of industry partners as well as by investing private investors' funds.

  Technology Mentor eduLAB / Founder Institute - supporting startups in local accelerators in product development, customer development, business development, business models etc.
