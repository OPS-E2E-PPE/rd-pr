  ## Bio
  Enterprise IT operates far differently today than it did a decade or even just
  five years ago. The modern app era is redefining the way that enterprise IT
  teams build, run, manage, and secure their applications. To stay competitive,
  businesses must be innovating all the time. Their customers expect
  personalized apps that anticipate their needs.
  
  As a Regional Director, I’m focusing efforts on using technology to provide
  better products and services to our customers or partners. My goal is to
  project and assess technologies' impact on the corporation and its customers.
  I’m also connected to the technical and academic communities.
