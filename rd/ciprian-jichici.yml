  ## Bio
  I am an IT professional with a business focus living in Timisoara, Romania. My
  primary executive position is CEO at [Genisoft](http://genisoft.eu/), one of
  the most innovative Microsoft partner companies in Romania. I am also vice-
  president of the board of directors at Timisoara International Airport.
  Previously, I acted as Chairman of the Urban Planning Committee at the City
  Council of Timisoara and as a member of the Directory Council of Timisoara
  Basketball Club.
  
  The sixteen years I spent researching and teaching computer science at the
  West University of Timisoara laid the theoretical and practical foundation of
  my cloud computing technical focus. Today I spend most part of my professional
  time designing, architecting, and managing the development of cloud computing
  solutions on Microsoft Azure. An important part of this activity is helping
  top-level business decision makers realize the potential of cloud computing.
  The challenges, complexity, and awesomeness of the many technologies I have to
  deal with is what drives and motivates me to learn more every day.
  
  Teaching and sharing is second nature to me, so you’ll find me often speaking
  at events and conferences, getting involved in IT communities, and educating
  people of all ages in computer science. From 10 year olds (like the ones I
  meet yearly at The Hour of Code) to seasoned professionals (like the ones I
  meet at Global Azure Bootcamp events or conferences around the world), I love
  to be in front of them to inspire or share knowledge. Still, in my heart I
  will always be a techie, and that’s why I devote some of my spare time to the
  study of data mining and quantum physics.
  
  My technical expertise has been recognized during my career with awards like
  the Microsoft Most Valuable Professional. For the past three years, I received
  the Microsoft Azure MVP award. The one recognition I am proudest of is being
  part of the Microsoft Regional Directors (RD) program for more than ten years
  now. Being an RD enables me to realize the full potential of my business and
  technical skills and engage constantly with communities, businesses, and
  Microsoft. On top of this, I get to be part of a global group that shares my
  passion for helping people use a wide range of technologies to make their
  lives or businesses better.
  
  Talk to me about Cloud Computing, Azure, Big Data, Mobile Development,
  Software Development, IoT, DevOps, Microservices, Azure, SaaS, PaaS, Data
  Analytics, NoSQL, iOS, Android, Visual Studio, ASP.NET, or C#.

  ## Spotlight
  Almost 20 years after my first exposure to Machine Learning, I find myself in
  the middle of a fundamental transformation of the industry driven by this
  sophisticated technology. The explosive development of cloud computing is
  fueling the shift towards including ever more intelligence into modern IT
  platforms. In a few short years, machine learning delivered via cloud
  computing became a ubiquitous and affordable technology. The value unlocked
  for organizations is tremendous. Whether it’s about increasing sales by better
  understanding customers, saving money by predicting failures or incidents, or
  increasing the accuracy of medical diagnostics, my work related to machine
  learning helps people do work faster and smarter.
  
  The speed of modern day changes is truly astounding. I firmly believe that we
  industry influencers have an important duty to share the knowledge we gain in
  complex and challenging projects. That’s why I always find time to talk to
  people about how and why our industry is changing. And I do this especially
  for the young following in our footsteps.
  
  The most important thing I’ve learned in this journey is that my career would
  not be complete without both customer success and the sharing of knowledge. I
  am fortunate and proud to be among the ones that do both.
