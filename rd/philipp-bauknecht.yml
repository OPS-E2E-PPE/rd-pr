  ## Bio
  Hi, I’m Philipp Bauknecht from Germany, Founder & CEO of medialesson GmbH. I
  help my customers design, architect, build and operate modern, beautiful and
  useable Apps that run on any platform as a consultant, architect and trainer
  together with my team of highly skilled designers and developers.
  
  Besides I teach Interface Design at the Pforzheim University and engage with
  the community as a speaker at conferences and user groups and organizer of
  code camps and hackathons.
  
  I was selected as one of the one hundred creative talents by the European
  Union and the Committee of the Regions. I co-founded the network EF.EU –
  European Forum for Enhanced Usability and a local industry initiative for IT
  (mitpf.de). I was awarded a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) for
  Client Development in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. In 2017 I was accepted
  into the Microsoft Regional Director
  ([rd.microsoft.com](https://rd.microsoft.com)) Program.
  
  I’m married, a father to identical twins and love to serve our community as a
  member of the [Rotary Club of Pforzheim](http://pforzheim.rotary.de).
