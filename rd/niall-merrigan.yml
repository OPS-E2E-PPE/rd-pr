  ## Bio
  My name is Niall Merrigan and I lead the Cybersecurity Unit in Norway at Capgemini. I am also a Microsoft MVP (since 2010) and now also a Microsoft Regional Director from 2019. I am originally from Ireland but now live in Norway.
  I am originally a software developer, but transitioned into the security arena over 15 years ago when I discovered how easy it was to make security mistakes and so I started really learning how this all worked and took an obsessive interest in it. Over the years I have worked with both large and small companies and even some government agencies helping them to build solutions for their needs.
  When I moved to Norway, it was a case of building back up my community network and I started speaking at local meetups on security topics, eventually finding myself at NDC Oslo which was my first major event. Since then I have spoken across the world on these topics and contnue to do so. I also help on agenda committees from time to time and motivate new speakers to give talks as well as do mentoring.
  As I said I lead a team, currently 30 security professionals, doing what they do best which is to protect our clients and their digital assets. As lead, I am responsible for all our security offers as well as helping companies succeed in their security journey. I advise our customers on the best in breed technology for their needs as well as helping shape their security culture.
  On the personal side, I reside in Norway with my wife and kids and mutant cat. I love to cook food, discover new wines and enjoy a good whiskey from time to time
