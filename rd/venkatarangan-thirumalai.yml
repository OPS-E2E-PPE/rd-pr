  ## Spotlight
  Years ago when I learned FoxBase in order to develop an inventory management
  system for my family-owned publishing house in South India. Existing staff
  were resistant to the change even though the PC could give inventory for all
  hundreds of titles accurately in near real-time. Something had to be done. I
  spent time in convincing and training the oldest stakeholder, a
  septuagenarian, and that was the game-changer.
  
  Having grasped the impact software can have on businesses, I have continued to
  design software that helps its users and remains easy to use. Recently I
  challenged myself to design a mobile app that was so simple users would feel
  it’s simplicity. Named Simpligic, it’s a NEWS app that has nothing to be
  configured or selected. The App uses Prediction.IO Machine Learning running in
  Microsoft Azure to come up with a story that the user will want to read at
  that instant, nothing more. Simply launch the app, read the story that appears
  and you’re done. No fuss. In the future, I plan to dictate the requirement for
  a Business App to Microsoft Cortana, who will automatically design, build and
  deploy an app to cloud that will be available to all my users within minutes.
