  product teams and their customers, helping product teams to better understand
  their customers' needs as well as assisting customers in leveraging

  ## Spotlight
  Technology moves fast and so am I. New technologies, new foundations and new
  services, provide a better foundation for building modern, always on, high
  scale applications and services. About a year ago, I realized the potential of
  Azure Service Fabric. I established an architecture team within my company,
  CodeValue, and together we have built the foundation for the new Kodak
  Photographer network – Kodakit.
  
  Kodakit is a B2B and B2C system that connects professional photographers with
  personal and business clients. As a Regional Director, I had access to the
  Service Fabric dev team that supported us during the time where the technology
  was still in its preview stage. Service Fabric allows us to build a high
  scale, high available, high performance, Microservice based system with less
  concerns regarding Microservice health management, state management and
  versioning. For the mobile application, I decided to use Xamarin. Using
  Xamarin provides the foundation for building cross platform, iOS, Android and
  Windows client applications while reducing the learning curve of the dev team
  by using the same familiar programming language and development tools.
  
  Nowadays, I am the architect of another microservice based solution, this time
  we use Docker Containers as our hosting and management environment, running
  Node.js and Angular 2.0 on Linux.
  
  Beside Microservices architecture I also develop Internet of Things systems
  and Cross Platform applications on Windows/Linux and mobile platforms using C#
  (Xamarin) and ISO C++.
