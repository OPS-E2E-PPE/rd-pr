  ## Bio
  Generalist. Problem solver. Developer. Designer. Speaker. Author. Trainer.
  Contrarian.
  
  I’ve been using software technology to solve problems for 40 years. These
  days, I have the great privilege of leading a world class team of developers,
  specializing in native applications on Microsoft platforms. We’ve done
  applications with an international reputation for innovation in user
  experience.
  
  We are not content to grind out another code-centric, buzzword-driven morass
  of an application that makes code-addicted technonerds happy, but doesn’t fit
  the needs of the user. Instead, we work with clients starting with
  investigation of the problem, through UX design and prototyping, and then
  architecting and developing the application in collaboration with client
  developers.
  
  That takes up about two-thirds of my time. I spend most of the rest sharing
  the lessons we’ve learned by speaking at major conferences, talking to CxOs at
  companies who depend on technology, writing books and articles, and doing
  training videos and classes. I began public speaking in the second grade, and
  yet I still get a charge out of walking on stage and showing audiences new
  concepts, new designs, and new ways to use software technology.
  
  I’ve been part of Microsoft Regional Director program for 19 years. That
  doesn’t mean I work for Microsoft. It means that I have the privilege of being
  in a group of some of the savviest people in the industry and learning from
  them, while contributing some of my own experiences and lessons. I’m also a
  Microsoft MVP in Windows Platform Development, and that gets some nice insider
  access to the Windows 10 / UWP team.
  
  If you need some out of the box thinking about using modern technologies to
  solve business problems, contact me. Together with my team, we have helped
  many organizations, from Fortune 100 to small companies, enter the modern app
  era
