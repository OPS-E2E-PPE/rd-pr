  ## Bio
  Welcome to my profile. My name is Richard Conway. I'm a Microsoft Regional
  Director and Microsoft Most Valuable Professional in Azure. I'm a Director of
  Elastacloud which is a Data Science consultancy working across key business
  sectors such as retail, finance, engineering and others.
  
  As well as my role in business, I'm an author of books and courses and a key
  contributor to Apache open source projects with a love for all things cloud
  and data. Over the years I've become proficient in C++, C#, Java, Scala,
  Python and R and I mix and match these skills for my customers and community
  on a daily basis.
  
  I love speaking to new audiences on aspects of cloud, data science and data
  platform and have spoken all across Europe over the last few years.
  
  I'm a strong advocate of communities and over the years founded @ukazure and a
  few others.
  
  As an advocate for child education in IT I've been working closely with Code
  Club in the UK. My most recent community contribution has been
  [AzureCraft](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ukschools/2016/05/16/3rd-4th-
  june-azurecraft-the-power-to-create-the-future-is-now-in-your-hands/), an
  annual two day event for developers, parents and kids to teach the Cloud and
  Programming through Minecraft.

  Learning, Deep Learning

  ## Spotlight
  As a Microsoft Regional Director I've always challenged the status quo in both
  my business and community activities. Having used Microsoft Azure since its
  inception to conquer difficult tasks, I've not let lack of a platform service
  stop me from building large scale data solutions.
  
  The combination of my zest for big data and data science led me to becoming an
  early adopter for Apache Spark and HDInsight. I’ve had the opportunity to
  transform a data orchestration pipeline for a large high-tech manufacturing
  company. Combinations of Apache Spark on HDInsight, R-Server and SQL DW were
  used to build precise ingestion pipelines that revolutionised the flow and
  scale of data. With such a heavy usage of Azure comes a heavy usage of
  governance so we also built in a fine-grained analytical control panel giving
  them cost-optimisation of all their Azure assets across 10s of subscriptions.
  
  I look at Microsoft Azure and can relate to Satya’s vision of the Intelligent
  Cloud. It’s been my privilege to live and breathe this vision as it unfolds
  before my eyes. In the years to come I see large scale adoption of intelligent
  services where Microsoft Azure is the bridge between analytics and devices
  providing real-time, low-latency answers to everything from medical diagnoses
  to predicting which cinema film I want to watch next.
