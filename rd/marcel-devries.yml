  ## Bio
  I am the co-founder and CTO of [Xpirit](http://xpirit.com), a high end
  consulting firm based in Hilversum, Netherlands.
  
  I co-founded Xpirit in 2014 as a spin off from [Xebia
  Netherlands](http://Xebia.com). Together with Xebia we help customers with
  Digital Transformation, Agile Consulting and Full Stack development with both
  Microsoft and open source products.
  
  I spend most of my time looking at how new emerging technologies, a shift in
  mindset and a new way of work, can help organizations get software in
  production faster. Helping organizations transform towards a high speed,
  innovative and productive organization has become my passion. I love to learn
  new technologies and teach others what I have learned. Besides my work as CTO
  I also work as a consultant in the field of Application Lifecycle Management,
  Continuous Delivery, DevOps, Cloud/Web scale application architectures and
  Cross platform Enterprise Mobile app development with Xamarin.
  
  I am a frequent speaker at leading industry conferences. I have delivered
  sessions at events like [Microsoft
  TechEd](https://channel9.msdn.com/events/TechEd/Europe/2014/DEV-B209),
  [Microsoft //Build](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/3-595),
  [Microsoft
  TechDays](https://channel9.msdn.com/events/TechDays/Techdays-2014-the-
  Netherlands/-Build-redux), Visual Studio Live!, Devintersection,
  [Xebicon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrqYuvSVpTI), and Techorama . I host
  several meetups in my region on [Microsoft
  Azure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrqYuvSVpTI),
  [Xamarin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrqYuvSVpTI)and
  [ALM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrqYuvSVpTI). In my spare time I am also
  an author of online courses at
  [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/marcel-devries).
  
  I have been awarded by Microsoft the Microsoft ALM MVP award for 11
  consecutive years and I am a Microsoft Regional Director since 2008.
  
  Talk to me about: DevOps, ALM, Cloud Computing, Microservices, Mobile
  Development, Docker, IaaS, PaaS, SaaS

  ## Spotlight
  As a Regional Director I’ve had the honor of co-organizing TechDays, a
  successful tech conference in the Netherlands that attracts about 2000
  developers each year. I’ve found that while giving primarily technical
  presentations at events like TechDays, it is very hard to make the conference
  attendees successful in applying what we teach them in their day job. Which
  begs the question: “How can we aid attendees in successfully adopting this
  cool technology after they leave the conference?”
  
  The answer we found is to teach Digital Transformation to leadership teams.
  Through Digital Transformation companies can increase efficiency, and drive
  faster innovation by reimagining their operations and embracing Cloud, DevOps
  and Open Source. Together with Microsoft, I designed a special track for
  company thought leaders. We handpicked a substantial group of CTOs and built a
  one day program focused on providing practical guidance on how to embrace the
  Digital Transformation. This ultimately helps the conference audience get a
  better landing place in their company and bring their innovative ideas to
  life.
