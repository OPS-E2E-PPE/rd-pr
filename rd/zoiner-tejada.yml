  ## Bio
  Hello there, it is an honor to meet you.
  
  I am most passionate about the business of software, with a strong combination
  of business and technical acumen. On the technical side, I have written 3
  books on Azure, a degree in computer science from Stanford, and have been
  designing and building complex solutions for almost 20 years.
  
  However, since I began my consulting business as a junior in high school it
  was never lost on me that excellent software without a profitable business is
  just vaporware.
  
  Today, Iâ€™m a Microsoft Regional Director and have authored 5 books capturing
  strategies to help Microsoft Partners build, grow and optimize successful
  consulting practices, just like I have done with my partners at Solliance. I
  am fortunate that I get to work with amazing clients to help them deliver
  profitable innovation.
  
  One of my favorite business of software success stories is a small mom and pop
  startup that we worked with- the matriarch and CEO had a big vision for where
  she wanted to take her media company that was selling PDFs to help special
  needs students learn to read. We helped them move away from selling static
  PDF's of news and lessons to offering highly interactive experiences that
  included narration and drag & drop puzzles and only required a browser. We
  enabled their digital transformation by realizing there was more value in this
  business than just providing the interactive article- we built a web-based
  digital publishing platform (running entirely in Azure) that let their staff
  build beautiful, interactive experiences and publish it for their subscribers
  to see without having to use any other tools. The end result? They grew
  quickly and were acquired at a significant valuation.
  
  How can I help you deliver profitable innovation?
