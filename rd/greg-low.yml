  ## Bio
  I’m one of the better-known database consultants in the world. In addition to
  deep technical skills, I have experience with business and project management
  and am known for my pragmatic approach to solving issues. My skill levels at
  dealing with complex situations and my intricate knowledge of the industry
  have seen me cut through difficult problems and situations in both large
  tier-1 and small organisations.
  
  I lead a boutique consultancy firm called SQL Down Under.
  
  Microsoft has specifically recognized my capabilities and appointed me to the
  Regional Director program. They describe it as consisting of “150 of the
  world's top technology visionaries chosen specifically for their proven cross-
  platform expertise, community leadership, and commitment to business results”.
  
  Regarding SQL Server, I’m a long-term Data Platform MVP and considered one of
  the foremost consultants in the world on that platform. Microsoft calls on me
  regularly to train and mentor their own premier field engineers, senior
  consultants, internal IT staff, and SQL Server product team members at
  worldwide locations. I’ve provided architectural guidance for some of the
  largest SQL Server implementations in the world and helped them to resolve
  complex issues. I was one of the two people first appointed as SQL Server
  Masters worldwide.
  
  For several years, I served on the global board for the Professional
  Association of SQL Server. I’m particularly proud of having helped it triple
  the size of its community, and more importantly to me, took it from being 90%
  USA based, to being a truly global community with 60% of chapters outside the
  USA.
  
  I’m considered a talented trainer and presenter, known for my ability to
  explain complex concepts with great clarity to people of all skill levels. I
  regularly present at top level tier-1 conferences around the world. My SQL
  Down Under podcast has a regular audience of over 40,000 listeners.
  
  Outside of work, my current main passion apart from my family is learning
  Mandarin Chinese. I'm determined to learn to read, write, speak, and
  understand it clearly. 
  
  ## Spotlight
  I work with a variety of clients from small start-ups to large utility
  companies and military groups to financial services industries. The latter
  deals with such large volumes of transactions, they inevitably struggle with
  large SQL Server databases that are becoming increasingly difficult and
  expensive to manage.
  
  Even though I predominantly work with data, I have a development background. 
  This allows me to effectively work with teams of developers to achieve
  significant outcomes. I can help to bridge the divide between developers 
  and database management teams.
  
  I helped a software house that writes applications for large retirement
  funds worldwide, to greatly improve how their applications interact with
  their databases. Without this work, the software house's clients would
  have needed to provide infrastructure orders of magnitude larger (and many
  orders of magnitude more expensive) to run the same applications.
