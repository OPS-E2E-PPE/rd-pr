  ## Bio
  Hey, Iâ€™m Eric, I'm the Founder and CEO of responsiveX, a Microsoft Azure MVP,
  a Microsoft Regional Director, a regular conference speaker, and the co-author
  of Step-by-Step Azure SQL Database from Microsoft Press.
  
  I am so passionate about business digital transformation that I started a
  company called responsiveX in 2012. responsiveX is a technology company that
  helps customers deliver great web, mobile and enterprise apps using the cloud
  and Azure. And we've had the privilege of working on some exciting projects,
  with some of the largest companies in the world.
  
  I've been deep into creating technology for almost two decades, starting with
  a web development startup and in multiple roles since including developer,
  consultant, technology executive and business owner.
  
  My family and I live between Chicago and Milwaukee where the winters are cold,
  but the summer's are beautiful and we love the area.
