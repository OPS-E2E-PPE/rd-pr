  ## Bio
  As a Vice President Consulting Service at [CGI](https://www.cgi.com/), I lead DevOps & Innovation for [CGI Next](https://www.cgi.com/us/en-us/cginext), 
  I drive the digital, cloud and DevOps transformation for my clients in Germany.

  I work for nearly 20 years in IT now. I’m a Microsoft MVP for ALM and DevOps ever since 2015 and I love to help my customers succeed in their enterprise 
  transformation. I can build bridges between Management and Engineering and I can coach teams and agile leaders. I love the community and I believe that 
  technical communities are an important part in the modern work life. I’m one of the organizers of [Azure Meetup Stuttgart](https://azurestuttgart.de) and 
  I regularly speak and sponsor other Meetups – all over Germany.

  My passion is sharing knowledge through public speaking, writing and mentoring. I’m a regular speaker at international conferences and I speak in English, 
  German and Spanish. I’ve published several articles and I regularly blog at [writeabout.net](https://writeabout.net/).
  Talk to me about DevOps, Cloud Computing, Azure, AWS, .NET, Clean Code, Scrum and Kanban
