  ## Bio
  Hey there, I’m Ryan. I’m a product leader and seasoned executive with a passion for finding efficiency and effectiveness in every walk of life, then scaling that out through innovation and cultural change.  I'm also an ex Microsoftie, having spent many years of my life working on the runaway success known as SharePoint.
  With over 20 years working in the software industry in the United States, United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia I’ve built and grown successful companies, driven product strategy, redefined markets, won multi-million dollar deals and managed global software development projects.  With an academic background in Computer Science and Psychology, my focus is on understanding people, identifying their unique problems and helping them to realize their true potential through creative application of technology.

  Outside of work, I like to focus on family, friends, coaching, advising, skiing, cycling, and Pilates.
