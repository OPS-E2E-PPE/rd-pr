  ## Bio
  I'm the CTO at Zarmada, a technology consulting group based in Seattle. We
  help our customers realize the potential of emerging technology trends from
  the earliest planning stages with market analysis & architectural guidance,
  through to execution with proofs of concept, hands-on training, & system
  implementation. Our clients include some of the world's largest public cloud
  providers and we've been privileged to have a front row seat for some of the
  biggest industry shifts in recent times including IoT, big data, and AI.
  
  With over a decade at the bleeding edge, I've accumulated a broad set of
  experiences solving diverse problems for our customers with solutions for
  devices, mobile, web, & cloud using the best offerings from a range of
  vendors. I'm a regular speaker at community events like Ignite and you can
  also find me on online platforms like Channel 9.
  
  Prior to Zarmada, I was a practice lead at Empired, one of the largest
  Microsoft partners in Australasia, and helped create their US-based innovation
