  ## Bio
  I am Chief Digital Officer for [iCubed](http://icubed.it/), a leading
  Microsoft Gold Partner, currently living in Milan, Italy.
  
  We help customers build fantastic and innovative applications, drive the
  digital transformation of their business, thought web, cloud, and new
  technologies. I'm also responsible for the learning division, thanks to my 20
  years of expertise in this area.
  
  I'm Microsoft Regional Director for Italy, helping customers to be in touch
  with Microsoft, and Microsoft ASP.NET MVP since 2002.
  
  In 1998 I founded and I'm currently serving as network manager for
  [ASPItalia.com](http://www.aspitalia.com/), the largest Italian dev community,
  counting about 70,000 users. I'm publishing code since 1998 with open source
  license, driving the Microsoft ecosystem in Italy to exchange more broadly.
  
  I'm a well-known professional author with 20+ published books, and a speaker
  at the main developer-focused events worldwide.
  
  I'm the organizer of [CommunityDays.it](http://www.communitydays.it/), the
  most important community conference in Italy, with 1,000+ participants every
  year.
  
  I'm an AC Milan fan, and very passionate about design and home automation.
  
  Talk to me about: Cloud Computing, Mobile Development, Software Development,
  Microsoft Office, PaaS, JavaScript, HTML5, AngularJS, jQuery, iOS Development,
  Android Development, Continuous delivery, Azure, .NET, Visual Studio, Software
  engineering, ASP.NET, C#

  ## Spotlight
  When I started web programming in 1997, being a Microsoft developer wasn’t
  considered “cool”. 20 years later, ASP.NET Core has become multi-platform
  which benefits me as a full stack web developer, enriching the ecosystem with
  new tools. In my experience, emerging technologies like Angular or TypeScript
  are changing the game, making it impossible to remain competitive on Windows-
  only technologies.
  
  At my company, iCubed, Azure was a key factor in our evolution. Azure and the
  way Microsoft has embraced Open Source has tremendously simplified the porting
  of services from on-premises to the cloud. We recently helped Microsoft Italy
  coach ISVs while they began their journey to the cloud by organizing a series
  of labs on their behalf. The return for the ISVs was simply amazing, because
  they could embrace the cloud more quickly. The cloud has such an impact on the
  way we build web services that being a Microsoft-only shop doesn’t cut it
  anymore. Azure can offer the same benefit to all kinds of developers.
  
  The Regional Director Program has helped grow my network by connecting me with
  influential people inside of Microsoft and presenting ways for me to consult
  and coach my favorite web programming topics, Visual Studio, and Azure, to
  both our customers and our community in Italy.
