  ## Bio
  Hello, I’m Hervé. I’m a consultant working in Paris (France), specialized on
  digital environnements & entreprise mobility.
  
  I am a fan of Microsoft for 20 years, leading the french System Center User
  Group during 8 years, and involved on Microsoft events (TechDays, ITCamp,
  TechNet, ...) & presales (Pseller) to promote technologies such as Windows 10,
  Enterprise Mobility Suite/intune, Office 365, System Center & Azure.
  
  MVP (Most Valuable Professional) on SMS/System Center Configuration Manager
  from 2008 to 2014, I have the great honour to be a Microsoft Regional Director
  (IT Pro) since 2015.

  ## Spotlight
  A company that offers higher education in luxury hotels and restaurants needed
  help deploying a complete and operational environment for over 100 first-time
  students within a short timeframe. They required Windows tablets in BYOD mode,
  a secured identity & access solution with AD on-premises remotely managed
  (VPN) by a service provider and GPOs for managing devices, and a billing
  solution suitable for a tight budget.
  
  I proposed using innovative Surface Pro 4 devices with a business store to
  highlight applications for BYOD usage. Regarding infrastructure, the best
  solution for the customer was “full cloud" based on EMS: Azure AD Premium to
  avoid any AD infrastructure on premise & VPN, AAD Device integration for
  single sign-on & automatic MDM enrollment, self-service portal for resetting
  students passwords & MFA for admins, and Microsoft Intune for device
  management.
  
  The final solution exceeded expectations by delivering 100% functional
  coverage, a digital environment considered “sexy as iOS” by students, and
  predictable costs (single payment package per user/month & no initial
  investment) in only 2 weeks’ time.
  
  Personally, I enjoyed providing a “real life” application of the Microsoft
  cloud’s ability to provide all services expected in an Information System with
  a simple, affordable funding model.
