  ## Bio
  
  Hey there, Iâ€™m Dana. I'm is a serial entrepreneur who has founded several 
  security-based software companies that I've taken public or sold through acquisition. 
  I have a passion for the startup growth mindset and believe that there aren't challenges 
  in every opportunity, but opportunities in every challenge. Everything is impossible until 
  someone does it.
  
  I've spent the last 25 years focusing on software security and have been awarded the recognition 
  and designation by Microsoft as an Enterprise Security MVP for the past fourteen years. These 
  past few years I was also awarded for my Azure experience in Cloud and Datacenter Management, and 
  was appointed as a Microsoft Regional Director.
  
  I travel regularly between my homes in Vancouver, British Columbia and Las Vegas, Nevada. When I'm 
  not working or touring around the world to speak about information security and security engineering, 
  you can find me engaging as an Azure Advisor with Microsoft offering suggestions, guidance and 
  recommendations to Microsoft's Azure strategy around technologies like cloud identity and security, 
  containerization and serverless computing.
